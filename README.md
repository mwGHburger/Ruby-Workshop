# Welcome to the Ruby 101 Workshop! ðŸ’Ž

Solve the following challenges with your workshop buddy (pair programming).

Here are the [Slides with Examples](tiny.cc/gd5tkz) | https://bit.ly/2PMM5OF

Cheatsheet for [Mac & Linux Users](https://www.slideshare.net/paalringstad/command-cheatsheets-mac)

Cheatsheet for [Windows Users](https://www.slideshare.net/paalringstad/command-cheatsheets-windows-138186563)

You can either use an online tool:
Use the online Ruby compiler [here](https://repl.it/languages/ruby)

OR

If you have downloaded a text editor like [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) & downloaded Ruby you can:

1. Create a new file <example_name.rb>
2. Run your ruby file from your terminal with "ruby <example_name.rb>"

### Section 1 | Data Types & Variables

---

**Challenge 1 - Integers**

Create a new variable. Assign it to an integer.
Create another variable. Assign it to another integer.
Print out the results of the following:

1. Add the two variables together
2. Subtract one variable from the other
3. Multiply the two variables together
4. Divide one variable from the other

**Challenge 2 - Strings & Concatenation**

Create a new variable. Assign it a string value.
Create another variable. Assign it to another string value.
Concatenate (add) the two strings together. Should there be a space between the two strings? If so, add in the space as well.

**Challenge 3 - Strings & Interpolation**

Create a new variable called `name` which is assigned to your own name.  
Print out a string that says `Hello, your_name - welcome to coding!` . Replace `your_name` with the variable `name` via interpolation (i.e. `#{variable_placed_here}`).

**Challenge 4 - Arrays**

Create a new variable.
Assign your variable to an array full of animals. Have at least 4 animals in your array.
Add another item into your array. Use the `<<` syntax.
Add another item into your array. Use the `+` syntax.

---

**Challenge 5 - While Loops**

Print out 5 times "You can enter the club!" using a while loop.

---

**Challenge 6 - Each Iterators**

students = ["Draco", "Harry", "Hermione"]

Print out all names of this array using "each".

---

**Challenge 7 - Arrays & Indices**

students = ["Draco", "Harry", "Hermione", "Luna"]

Print out the first student of this array.

---

**Challenge 8 - Arrays & Indices**

students = ["Draco", "Harry", "Hermione", "Luna"]

Print out the first letter of the first element of this array.

---

**Challenge 9 - Arrays & Conditionals**

students = ["Draco", "Harry", "Hermione", "Luna"]

Print out the second element of the array, but only after having checked if it starts with an "H". Use an if statement.

---

**Challenge 10 - Arrays & Combinations**

students = ["Draco", "Harry", "Hermione", "Luna"]

Time to combine everything you learned! Print out all names that start with an "H". You must use an "each" loop and an if statement.

---

**Challenge 11 - Methods**

students = ["Draco", "Harry", "Hermione", "Luna"]

Create a method that prints out all students names (on one line) that start with a specific letter.
The method must take two parameters: 1) An array of students 2) A letter

---

**Challenge 12 - Methods**

Create a method called "dating_app" that takes 2 or more arguments (hobbies, age, IQ, sense of humor, etc.). This method should let you know whether the person is a good match for you. ðŸ˜‰
